## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this challenge, I improved my skills in creating responsive layouts using Flexbox. I learned how to effectively use media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes. Additionally, I practiced implementing hover and focus states to enhance user interaction.

One specific technique I learned was how to change the image source based on the screen size using CSS. Here is the code snippet I used to achieve that:

```css
.image-section img {
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
  content: url('../images/image-product-desktop.jpg');
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue improving my skills in responsive design and CSS techniques. I plan to explore more about CSS Grid and advanced Flexbox layouts to create more complex designs. Additionally, I aim to enhance my understanding of accessibility best practices to ensure my projects are usable by everyone.
